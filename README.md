# Codeless_API_Client_V2
_A POC of Refit for demonstrating and comparing with other clients_

This project is a demonstration on how to use Refit and also a comparer to other clients (HttpClient and RestSharp)
It can be used to Demo sessions or to understand how it works and compare the benefits of each client.

Codeless, because Refit is a library that allows you to create a client for an API without writing any code. You just need to create an interface with the methods you want to use and Refit will create the implementation for you.

Of course you still need to configure the client, but it is very simple and easy to do.

Please refer to Refit Documentation on https://github.com/reactiveui/refit for more informations.
